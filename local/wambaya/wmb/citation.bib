  abstractNote = {This paper presents a case study in
                  grammar engineering for linguistic hypothesis
                  testing, focusing on the treatment of second
                  position auxiliaries in an HPSG grammar for
                  Wambaya. A detailed comparison of two versions of
                  this grammar highlights the interconnectedness of
                  linguistic phenomena, the model-dependence of
                  linguistic analyses, and the value of computational
                  support in calculating the consequences of differing
                  analytical choices.},
